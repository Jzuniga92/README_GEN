## README Generator

## Development 

 I wanted to create a program that would help other developers create a profesional README for any project that they wanted.

## Description 

Using Node and Markdown, I have created a program that can easily and quickly create a professional README.md. With this program you will answer a series of 
questions pertaining to the README. Once all questions have been answered the a README.md will be generated and added to you file.

## HOW IT WORKS

 The program is very simple to use. 
 - 1. Open your intergrated terminal for your project. 
 - 2. In the terminal you will enter node index.js.
 - 3. You will then be prompted with a series of questions dedicated to the README.
 - 4. Your README will then generate and automatically be add to your project.
